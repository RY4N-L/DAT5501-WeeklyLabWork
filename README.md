## 🌟 Highlights

- Built **GUI applications** with Tkinter and tkcalendar (Week‑3 & Week‑5).  
- Conducted a **group project** analysing global meat consumption vs CO₂ emissions using Our World in Data (Week‑3).  
- Implemented **unit testing** to validate calculations (Week‑1).  
- Analyzed **US election data** with fuzzy matching and histograms (Week‑5).  
- Extended **asset price analysis** to test sorting performance against *n log n* complexity (Week‑8).  
- Performed **polynomial fitting and forecasting** on global population trends, calculating χ²/dof and BIC to evaluate models (Week‑8).

## 🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RY4N-L/DAT5501_lab.git
cd DAT5501_lab
```
Navigate to a week folder and run the script:

```bash
cd Week-2

## 📝 Outstanding Tasks / To‑Do

- [ ] Complete parameter extraction and covariance matrix analysis for the best polynomial model (Week‑8)  
- [ ] Estimate uncertainties in parameter values  
- [ ] Explore alternative models (e.g., exponential fits) for forecasting  
- [ ] Extend GUI functionality with additional features (e.g., error handling, styling)  
- [ ] Add more unit tests for robustness across weeks
